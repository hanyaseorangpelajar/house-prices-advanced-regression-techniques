<h1 align="center">Overview</h1>
<p>Ask a home buyer to describe their dream house, and they probably won't begin with the height of the basement ceiling or the proximity to an east-west railroad. But this playground competition's dataset proves that much more influences price negotiations than the number of bedrooms or a white-picket fence.

With 79 explanatory variables describing (almost) every aspect of residential homes in Ames, Iowa, this competition challenges you to predict the final price of each home.</p>

<h1 align="center">Goal</h1>
<p>It is your job to predict the sales price for each house. For each Id in the test set, you must predict the value of the SalePrice variable. </p>
